# Strike-Bot
Strike-Bot is a Discord Bot written in C# that makes use of the .NET wrapper Discord.Net, written by RougeException.

*Note:This is still heavily a work-in-progress.*

**Future Goals/Plans**
  <p>I plan on continuing to work on the bot, adding more commands as things go along. Potential ideas also include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Audio/Music Playback Feature: Similar to KoopaKiy's fork of SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot, which is originally written by imayhaveborkedit.</li>
  </ul>
